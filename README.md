# RAG_repo
Mini RAG - (Python, AI‑oriented)
Download the Sample_Docs_Markdown folder from Hugging Face: vibrantlabsai/Sample_Docs_Markdown.
Build a RAG pipeline in Python that allows a user to ask questions about the documents: load all .md files, split them into chunks, create embeddings and index them in a vector store, retrieve the top‑k most relevant chunks for a query, and generate an answer grounded in the retrieved context. 
The output should include the answer as well as the supporting references (e.g., file name and chunk id / snippet) that were used to produce it.
